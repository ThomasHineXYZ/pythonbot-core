discord:

Any other subsystem that triggers on messages will need to be *AFTER* this 
module in parsing order

on startup:
  Not much to do.
  1. Is cli channel enabled?
    1. Yes, check to make sure it is configured. (no idea)
    ----
    1. No, create the channel

1. user types message:
2. Is this an alias? (an alias begins with a command character and like
  mentions can be executed anywhere)
3. is this a command?
  1. Yes, parse command (Commands are either prefixed with the mention of the 
    bot anywhere, or in a designated cli channel.)
  2. execute command
  3. exit
  ------------
  1.No, ignore.

So what do we need for CLI handling? Can this all be handled by the 
action factory?

It must:
  * expand aliases/macros and allow them to be defined and manipulated.
  * it must recognize a set of commands and generate executable objects
    based on the command.

I need a list of permissions for roles

Then I need to shore up all the roles I want on the discord

bot access will be determined by role and eventually a key/security system.
