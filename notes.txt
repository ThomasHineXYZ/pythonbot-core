USE mysql;
SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user;


CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
UPDATE user SET plugin='auth_socket' WHERE User='user';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;

show variables like 'validate_password%';
SET GLOBAL validate_password.check_user_name=OFF;
SET GLOBAL validate_password.length=1;
SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy=LOW;
SET GLOBAL validate_password.mixed_case_count=0;

SET GLOBAL validate_password.special_char_count=0;


1. set root user to mysql_native_password

$ sudo mysql -u root -p # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql:~ USE mysql;
SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user;
mysql:~ UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql:~ FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql:~ exit;

$ service mysql restart 

Mysql change user password using the following method:

    Open the bash shell and connect to the server as root user
    mysql -u root -h localhost -p
    Run command:
    ALTER USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

    

Reddit:

What will I need for the feed?

  A from. reddit/subreddit/multireddit feed.

Comment Feed (No sends, just reads, access to redditors)
  From and To (reddit to group->channel)
  Paginate Comments
Post Feed (no sends, just reads, access to redditors)
  from and to (subreddit new/top/etc, or multi-reddit feed)
  paginate posts
User catalog
  On start up reads recorded users in db (creates table if none)
  Then reads the active users in the discord
    Compare -> record news
  These All need to be tracked per user
    On Join/On Part
    on online/offline

System:
  A Discord/console/file out collective logger 
    TO group->Channel (Just sends, no reads, access to all)
  a bot CLI
    Everyone at least past redditor should have access

We're going to need paginators for:

CodeBlock pag
Reddit Submissions -> All types
Reddit Comments

Instead of making the page controls or yes/no prompt to be part of the paginator, it should be a separate class.

OR page controls should only be put on if there is more than one page of information.
Then I can make a separate class for the y/n prompt that will take any message and attach a y/n to itself.
