User Registration system:

User_Table -> A database that stores
Columns:
  Discord_id:
    Source -> discord user snowflake id
    type -> long integer
  Reddit

Functions:

  update userlist -> make sure each user is cataloged
  add/remove user
  register reddit account -> add reddit account to records
    this should be unique but someone could possibly give a duplicate
  validate user -> mark the user as having gone through the validation process

Routines:

  Last online -> This should record (recorded in table) when a user goes
    out of 'online' status, and clears when they are in online.

Reddit:

#######################

System:
  A Discord/console/file out collective logger 
    TO group->Channel (Just sends, no reads, access to all)
  a bot CLI
    Everyone at least past redditor should have access

We're going to need paginators for:

CodeBlock pag
Reddit Submissions -> All types
Reddit Comments

Instead of making the page controls or yes/no prompt to be part of the paginator, it should be a separate class.

OR page controls should only be put on if there is more than one page of information.
Then I can make a separate class for the y/n prompt that will take any message and attach a y/n to itself.
